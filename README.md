## Repository made for studying ERLANG

### Important notes
- Use observer:start() - It allows you to see some sort of memory usage/sockets thing.
- Always quit with Ctrl + G, q. This won't stop running the server.


### Not recommended, use if necessary
- -compile(export_all). (Gets all functions, bad for debugging)
